## Description
Deploy infrastructure for games and apps in the free tier of AWS.

## The Mission
Free Tier Deploys AWS aims to provide a set of "stacks" that set up working infrastructure and facilitate the deployment of game and app servers in AWS.  It is intended for both fun and profit. We like to play games and deploy cloud apps, but these stacks can also be used as a training ground to learn AWS services and features. You should be able to deploy these stacks in your personal AWS account and get ready to use games and apps with no changes to the code, and without needing in depth experience with AWS. All resources being deployed will be eligible for the AWS Free Tier. If you are using these stacks for learning AWS you will incur very little cost, and if you are using them to host real things you intend to host more persistently they will be very cheap.
