# freetierdeploys

## Description
Deploy infrastructure for games and apps in the cloud, cheaply and easily.

## The Mission
FreeTierDeploys aims to provide a set of "stacks" that set up working infrastructure and facilitate the deployment of game or app servers in the cloud. It is intended for both fun and profit. We like to play games and deploy cloud apps, but these stacks can also be used as a training ground to learn cloud provider services and features. You should be able to deploy these stacks in your personal cloud accounts and be ready to use games/apps with no changes to the code, and without needing in depth experience with the cloud. If you are using these stacks for learning a cloud provider you will incur very little cost, and if you are using them to host real things you intend to host more persistently they will be about as cheap as can be.
